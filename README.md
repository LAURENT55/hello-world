# hello-world
I'm learning to code using HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP! Today I'm very happy, because it's my first time on GitHub !
I live in Paris, and i'm so happy to write words for the first time on GitHub ! I4m now learning to make web pages, using HTML and CSS!
Sometimes, it's easy, sometimes less, but, anyway, trying and learning are necessary conditions!
If somebody reads what i wrote, he or she is welcome, and i'd be glad to have opinions and advices about coding in an efficient way!
So i'm waiting for you !
